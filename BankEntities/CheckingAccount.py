# Withdraw:
# Before the super class method is called, this method will determine if a
# withdrawal (a check written) will cause the balance to go below $0. If the
# balance goes below $0, a service charge of $15 will be taken from the account.
# The withdrawal will not be made due to insufficient funds. If there isnâ€™t enough
# in the account to pay the service charge, the balance will become negative and
# the customer will owe the negative amount to the bank.
